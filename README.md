<h1> Hyperspectral Image Analysis on Remote sensing datasets </h1>
</div>

<!-- ## HSI-Remote_Sensing -->

**Hyperspectral Imaging** is a powerful technique that captures and analyzes a wide spectrum of light across hundreds of narrow bands. This technology allows for detailed material identification, pattern recognition, and classification across diverse fields, including environmental monitoring, medical imaging, agriculture, art conservation, and more.

> This repository demonstrates application of some machine learning algorithms, particularly unsupervised learning techniques, to analyze hyperspectral remote sensing datasets. 

## Language and Tools

This repository provides implementations in both **Python** and **Julia**, offering flexibility for experimentation and optimization. 

## Datasets

This project currently works with these public hyperspectral remote sensing datasets. 

- **Pavia Centre and Pavia University Scene** - Captured by the ROSIS sensor over Pavia, Italy. 

- **Salinas** - Acquired by the AVIRIS sensor over Salinas Valley, California.

- **Onera Satellite Change Detection** - Images acquired by sentinel-2 satellites between 2015 and 2018 with locations all over the world, in Brazil, USA, Europe, Middle-East, and Asia.
